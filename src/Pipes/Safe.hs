{-| This module provides an orphan 'MonadMask' instance for 'Proxy' of the
    form:

> instance (MonadMask m, MonadIO m) => MonadMask (Proxy a' a b' b m) where

    Which is needed to implement the instance for MonadSafe for Proxy.

    This module also provides generalized versions of some 'MonadCatch'
    operations so that you can also protect against premature termination of
    connected components.  For example, if you protect a 'readFile' computation
    using 'bracket' from this module:

> -- readFile.hs
> import Pipes
> import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
> import Pipes.Safe
> import qualified System.IO as IO
> import Prelude hiding (readFile)
>
> readFile :: FilePath -> Producer' String (SafeT IO) ()
> readFile file = bracket
>     (do h <- IO.openFile file IO.ReadMode
>         putStrLn $ "{" ++ file ++ " open}"
>         return h )
>     (\h -> do
>         IO.hClose h
>         putStrLn $ "{" ++ file ++ " closed}" )
>     P.fromHandle

    ... then this generalized 'bracket' will guard against both exceptions and
    premature termination of other pipes:

>>> runSafeT $ runEffect $ readFile "readFile.hs" >-> P.take 4 >-> P.stdoutLn
{readFile.hs open}
-- readFile.hs
import Pipes
import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
import Pipes.Safe
{readFile.hs closed}

    Note that the 'MonadCatch' instance for 'Proxy' provides weaker versions of
    'mask' and 'uninterruptibleMask' that do not completely prevent asynchronous
    exceptions.  Instead, they provide a weaker guarantee that asynchronous
    exceptions will only occur during 'Pipes.await's or 'Pipes.yield's and
    nowhere else.  For example, if you write:

> mask_ $ do
>     x <- await
>     lift $ print x
>     lift $ print x

    ... then you may receive an asynchronous exception during the 'Pipes.await',
    but you will not receive an asynchronous exception during or in between the
    two 'print' statements.  This weaker guarantee suffices to provide
    asynchronous exception safety.

{- $utilities
    These utilities let you supply a finalizer that runs in the 'Base' monad
    (i.e. the monad directly beneath 'SafeT').  If you don't need to use the
    full power of the 'Base' monad and you only need to use to use 'IO', then
    just wrap the finalizer in 'liftIO', like this:

> myAction `finally` (liftIO myFinalizer)

    This will lead to a simple inferred type with a single 'MonadSafe'
    constraint:

> (MonadSafe m) => ...

    For examples of this, see the utilities in "Pipes.Safe.Prelude".

    If you omit the 'liftIO', the compiler will infer the following constraint
    instead:

> (MonadSafe m, Base m ~ IO) => ...

    This means that this function would require 'IO' directly beneath the
    'SafeT' monad transformer, which might not be what you want.
