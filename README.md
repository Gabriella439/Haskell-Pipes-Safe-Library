# Pipes-Safe

`pipes-safe` builds upon
[the `pipes` library](https://github.com/Gabriella439/Haskell-Pipes-Library) to
provide exception safety and resource management.

## Quick start

* Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* `cabal install pipes-safe`

The official tutorial is on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-safe).

## Features

* *Resource Safety*: Guarantee finalization using `finally`, `bracket`, and more

* *Exception Safety*: Even against asynchronous exceptions!

* *Laziness*: Only acquire resources when you need them

* *Promptness*: Finalize resources early when you are done with them

* *Native Exception Handling*: Catch and resume from exceptions inside pipes

* *No Buy-in*: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged pipes using `hoist`

## Outline

Use `pipes-safe` for production code where you need deterministic and prompt
release of resources in the fact of exceptions or premature pipe termination.
`pipes-safe` lets you safely acquire resources and handle exceptions within
pipelines.

## Development Status

`pipes-safe` is mostly stable.  Research into prompter finalization alternatives
will take place in a separate library.

## Community Resources

Use the same resources as the core `pipes` library to learn more, contribute, or
request help:

* [Haskell wiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pipes)

* [Mailing list](mailto:haskell-pipes@googlegroups.com) ([Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/haskell-pipes))

## How to contribute

* Build derived libraries

* Write `pipes-safe` tutorials
